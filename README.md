vtk_tcl_thread_util
===================

Provides a Tcl package that includes a single function to enable passing vtkObject handles between Tcl threads. 


### usage

The package vtk_tcl_thread_util provides a single function:


**vtk_tcl_thread_util::register_vtk_object** *threadid vtk_obj ?name?*

 This can be used to register the vtk object command *vtk_obj* with the interpreter of thread *threadid*. The resulting name of the object in the thread is returned, which can be either specified with *name*, or autogenerated. In the case where *vtk_obj* has previously been registered in the interpreter of *threadid*, and *name* is not specified, then it's previous name will be returned. 

An example:

```
package require vtk_tcl_thread_util

set obj [vtkObject New]; # init a VTK object
set t [thread::create {package require vtk_tcl_thread_util; thread::wait}]; # spawn a thread
set t_obj [vtk_tcl_thread_util::register_vtk_object $t $obj]; # t_obj now holds the name of the object in the spawned thread
```

Note that the refcount of the object is incremented whenever it is successfully registered with a new thread. This should ensure that the memory of the underlying VTK object will be freed only when it is released from all threads.

Do be careful - VTK itself is [not thread-safe](http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/FAQ#Is_VTK_thread-safe_.3F "VTK not thread-safe") in general.
